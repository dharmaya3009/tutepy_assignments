# Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 3** from **Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**. The assignment includes two main tasks demonstrating the use of user-defined functions and built-in Python modules.

## ðŸ§© Tasks Overview

### âœ… Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

- **Description**:  
  This script defines a function `factorial(n)` that computes the factorial of a number using recursion or loops. The function is then called with a sample input, and the result is printed.

- **Example Output**:
  ```
  Enter a number: 5
  The factorial of 5 is: 120
  ```

### âœ… Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

- **Description**:  
  This script takes a number as input from the user and uses Python's built-in `math` module to compute:
  - The square root of the number
  - The natural logarithm (log base e)
  - The sine of the number (in radians)

- **Example Output**:
  ```
  Enter a number: 25
  Square Root: 5.0
  Natural Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
  Sine (radians): -0.13235175009777303
  ```
